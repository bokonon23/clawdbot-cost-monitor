*Beautiful dark theme showing: lifetime cost tracking, prompt caching savings (85% off!), 7-day history chart, and real-time session monitoring*

## The Problem

OpenClaw/Clawdbot users have no idea what they're spending:
- "I've been using this for 2 days, spent $300+ on what felt like basic tasks" (Hacker News)
- "Is this going to cost me $10 or $150 this month?"
- Claude's dashboard shows API usage, but not OpenClaw-specific costs
- No way to predict monthly spending

## The Solution

A **stunning, modern dashboard** with advanced analytics and beautiful UI:

**🎨 Beautiful Dark Theme UI (NEW in v0.4.0):**
- ✅ Modern glassmorphism design with animated particles
- ✅ Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- ✅ Professional gradient cards with hover effects
- ✅ Fully responsive mobile-first design
- ✅ Dark mode optimized for long viewing sessions

**📊 Real-Time Tracking:**
- ✅ Live cost updates (refreshes every 5 seconds)
- ✅ Total cost across all sessions
- ✅ Token usage breakdown (input/output/cached)
- ✅ Cost by model (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- ✅ Interactive tooltips explaining costs

**💚 Prompt Caching Analytics (v0.3.0+):**
- ✅ Shows exactly how much you're saving with caching
- ✅ 90% discount visualization on cached tokens
- ✅ Detailed breakdown of token types
- ✅ Green "savings card" celebrating your discounts

**📈 Historical Analytics:**
- ✅ 7-day cost history with beautiful charts
- ✅ Daily spending trends
- ✅ Animated Chart.js visualizations

**🎯 Budget Projections:**
- ✅ Monthly cost projection based on usage
- ✅ Daily burn rate calculation
- ✅ Configurable budget alerts
- ✅ Warning and critical alert states

**🔄 Works Everywhere:**
- ✅ All AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple OpenClaw sessions
- ✅ Claude Pro users tracking API overflow
- ✅ Works with both OpenClaw and legacy Clawdbot installs

## ⚡ Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bokonon23/clawdbot-cost-monitor.git
cd clawdbot-cost-monitor
npm install
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:3939** in your browser. That's it!

The dashboard automatically:
- Detects your OpenClaw or Claude Code installation
- Parses JSONL session files for complete message history
- Calculates costs from every single API call
- Updates in real-time (every 30 seconds)
- Shows prompt caching savings with per-model pricing

**No configuration required.** Just run it.

### Optional Configuration

Environment variables for customization:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3939` | Port for the dashboard |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (localhost only by default for security) |

To allow network access (e.g., WSL from Windows host):
```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

## 🛠️ Run as a macOS Service (Launch at Login + Auto-Restart)

Want the dashboard to start automatically when your Mac boots and restart if it crashes? Use the built-in LaunchAgent:

```bash
npm run service:install
```

That will:
- Install a LaunchAgent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.cost-monitor.plist`
- Start it immediately
- Restart it automatically on crash

To uninstall:

```bash
npm run service:uninstall
```

Logs:
- `~/Library/Logs/openclaw-cost-monitor.log`
- `~/Library/Logs/openclaw-cost-monitor.error.log`

## How It Works

1. **Finds JSONL session files** from:
   - OpenClaw: `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl`
   - Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
2. **Parses every message** with usage data (tokens + costs)
3. **Uses pre-calculated costs** from OpenClaw when available, or calculates with correct per-model pricing
4. **Aggregates by day and model** for detailed analytics
5. **Updates in real-time** as you use the AI

**Supports both formats:**
- OpenClaw: `usage.input`, `usage.output`, `usage.cacheRead`, `usage.cacheWrite`, `usage.cost.total`
- Claude Code: `usage.input_tokens`, `usage.output_tokens`, `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`, etc.

## Why Your Costs Are Lower Than Expected 💚

**Good news:** OpenClaw/Clawdbot uses **Prompt Caching**, which dramatically reduces costs!

### What is Prompt Caching?

Every time you chat with AI, it needs your full conversation history. Without caching, you'd pay full price for resending that entire history every turn.

With **Prompt Caching** (Anthropic Claude feature):
- Repeated context is stored and reused
- **90% discount** on cached tokens ($0.30/M instead of $3.00/M)
- Makes long conversations 5-10x cheaper

### Real Example:

**Typical chat turn:**
- New input: 100 tokens × $3.00/M = **$0.0003**
- Chat history (cached): 27,000 tokens × $0.30/M = **$0.0081** 
- AI response: 500 tokens × $15.00/M = **$0.0075**
- **Total: $0.0159** (~1.6 cents per message)

**Without caching, that same turn would cost $0.0909** (9 cents) — over 5x more!

### How the Dashboard Shows This

The cost monitor now displays:
- **Green savings card** showing how much caching saved you
- **Token breakdown** (input / output / cached)
- **Real costs** based on the actual pricing including cache discounts

If you were using the old version (v0.2.x or earlier), costs were **overestimated by 10x** because caching wasn't accounted for. The fixed version (v0.3.0+) shows accurate costs.

## Supported Models

| Model | Input | Output | Cache Write | Cache Read |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $15/M | $75/M | $18.75/M | $1.50/M |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3/M | $15/M | $3.75/M | $0.30/M |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.80/M | $4/M | $1.00/M | $0.08/M |
| GPT-4 | $30/M | $60/M | - | - |
| GPT-4 Turbo | $10/M | $30/M | - | - |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | $0.50/M | $1.50/M | - | - |

*Prices per million tokens. Cache pricing reflects Anthropic's 90% discount on cached reads.*

## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js 14+** (16+ recommended)
- **OpenClaw or Claude Code** installed with session history
- Session files in one of these locations:
  - OpenClaw: `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl`
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No session files found"**
- Make sure OpenClaw or Claude Code has run at least once
- Check that JSONL files exist:
  - OpenClaw: `ls ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl`
  - Claude Code: `find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl"`

**"Costs don't match Claude Console"**
- The dashboard shows ALL historical data, not just the current billing period
- Check the daily breakdown to see costs per day
- Make sure you're on **v0.6.0 or later** (JSONL parsing)

**"Connection error / Won't connect"**
- Port 3939 might be in use. Check with: `lsof -i :3939`
- Kill the process and restart: `npm start`

**"WSL: localhost doesn't work"**
- Use the WSL IP directly: `hostname -I` to get the IP
- Or set up port forwarding in Windows
