# X Article Image Spec (5:2 Aspect Ratio)

**Recommended size:** 2000x800px (or 1500x600px)

---

## Design Option 1: Quote-Focused (Recommended)

**Background:**
- Dark gradient (navy to purple, like cost monitor UI)
- Or: Clean white with subtle texture

**Main Text:**
```
"I Don't Use MCPs 
or Any of That Crap"
```
- Font: Bold, modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, Helvetica)
- Size: 80-100px
- Color: White on dark, or dark navy on light

**Attribution:**
```
— Peter Steinberger
  OpenClaw Creator (300K LOC with AI)
```
- Font: Regular weight, slightly smaller
- Color: Gray/muted

**Visual Element:**
- Simple terminal icon or cursor in corner
- Or: Lobster claw emoji 🦞 (OpenClaw's logo)

---

## Design Option 2: Before/After Contrast

**Split screen (left/right):**

**LEFT SIDE (red/wrong):**
```
❌ The Agentic Trap

• 20+ agent orchestrators
• Ralph loops burning tokens
• MCPs and complexity
• 26-hour vanity runs

→ SLOP
```

**RIGHT SIDE (green/correct):**
```
✅ What Actually Works

• Simple terminals
• Human conversation
• Taste + iteration
• Ship products

→ 300K LINES SHIPPED
```

---

## Design Option 3: Minimalist Typography

**Center-aligned, lots of white space:**

```
Simple Tools
   +
Human Taste
   =
Shipping Code
```

Large, clean typography. Nothing else.

Bottom corner: *— Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw*

## Design Option 4: Terminal Aesthetic

**Make it look like a terminal window:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ $ openclaw-creator-reveals-workflow     │
│                                         │
│ > "I don't use MCPs or any of that     │
│   crap."                               │
│                                         │
│ > Human taste + simple tools            │
│   = 300K lines shipped                  │
│                                         │
│ — Peter Steinberger                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Readable at thumbnail size
- Professional but edgy
- Credits Peter properly
